1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Return of Ultraman

2
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
See you!

3
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,500
Troops.

4
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,500
The meteorite that fell onto Hiratsune City moments ago

5
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
destroyed at least 1,300 houses.

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,558
Nearly 16,000 people are missing or deceased.

7
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,558
Central Hiratsune City has been devastated.

8
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,558
This

9
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:34,558
is our current situation.

10
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Orders To Fire MAT Arrow 1

11
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,578
Destroying buildings

12
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,518
With the tremor that erupts

13
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:06,596
From the cries of the monster

14
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:11,576
the giant monster

15
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:14,593
It opens with a roar

16
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,550
And fire pours from its mouth

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,594
Scorching all of the

18
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:27,548
surrounding fields

19
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:31,521
The city is in trouble

20
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,585
The fire is approaching

21
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,555
He has returned

22
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:37,539
He has returned

23
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,539
He has returned!

24
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,529
Ultraman, Ultraman

25
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:49,560
Ultraman!

26
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,501
This is a digital simulation created using the

27
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:06,501
information from the Cyclops surveillance satellite.

28
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,512
Shown rotating is the meteorite, Lambda 1, that hit Hiratsune City.

29
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,539
As you can see

30
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,539
there's no sign of anything that fell off after entering the atmosphere.

31
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,579
Moving on.

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,532
According to this, the resulting impact

33
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,530
has almost entirely taken out central Hiratsune City.

34
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,530
Please look at this.

35
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,530
It's an enlarged map of Hiratsune city.

36
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:31,574
The 10-kilometer red area has been devastated.

37
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,574
The yellow area, destroyed.

38
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,551
However, there is still the outer areas

39
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,545
that could contain at least 5000 survivors, to take into consideration.

40
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:41,558
Hmmm.

41
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:45,525
Lambda 1 has a diameter of 60 meters

42
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,525
and an estimated weight of 130 kilotons.

43
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,569
Wait, that doesn’t add up.

44
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,556
Aren’t meteorites just masses of rock?

45
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:56,520
With a diameter of 60 meters…

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Exactly

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,567
At the most, it should be about 600 kilos.

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,534
Take a look at this.

49
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:05,511
This is a live model of Lambda 1 sent to us from MAT

50
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,538
At a glance, it appears to be a typical meteorite

51
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,518
But

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,550
Upon further analysis of a cross-section from protruding section

53
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,545
there seems to be something inside with the diameter of 40 meters.

54
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:20,584
Also, while weak we observed signs of life.

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,526
Huh, a 40-meter cavity?

56
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,556
We’ll treat it as a meteorite.

57
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,577
Reporting the situation.

58
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:35,594
Lambda 1, separating.

59
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,511
It’s splitting into 3 and moving away.

60
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,566
We’re getting a strong signal of life

61
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,555
on top of brain wave activity.

62
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,531
It’s a monster!

63
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,508
It’s an invasion.

64
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,591
We are being invaded.

65
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,535
Lambda 1 is probably not a meteorite

66
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,569
but a capsule sent from space to take out Earth.

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,539
It’s likely that its actually a monster.

68
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,536
Yamaga

69
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,530
Imamura

70
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,536
Hayakawa

71
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,580
Take off immediately

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
in the MAT Gyro 1, 2, and 3.

73
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,577
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:09,544
Ibuki, prepare for takeoff in the MAT Arrow 1.

75
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:10,500
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:12,541
Yes, sir.

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,531
Contact the Earth Defense Force Headquarters.

78
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,521
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,521
We’re entering into

80
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,568
emergency level 1.

81
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:12,537
Captain

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,524
The EDF Headquarters concluded that

83
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,510
due to no survivors from the meteorite

84
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,566
the use of nuclear weapons is unavoidable

85
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,566
and thus we should move to emergency level 4.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,508
Understood.

87
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,569
A monster that rode a meteor to invade.

88
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:34,575
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.

89
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,510
If space’s strongest monster, Kiruan, has returned

90
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,526
Hayakawa

91
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:40,516
Ah, yes!

92
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,584
We’re heading to Hiratsune City in 2 minutes

93
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,540
don’t have second thoughts now.

94
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:46,573


95
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,070
the 3 life-forms begin attacking

96
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,578
the ruins of Hiratsune City.

97
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,541
This is the current state of Hiratsune City.

98
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,541
Relaying the sensor's information.

99
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,541
Alright, Hayakawa.

100
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,558
Be careful out there.

101
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:37,505
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,537
Nothing much down there.

103
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,531
 Just a bunch of moles, locust, and broken buildings.

104
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,527
What’s this?

105
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:01,564
Directly below is

106
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,520
a reading!

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,538
Yamaga!

108
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,525
T-The hydraulic system is at its limit!

109
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:11,530
I’m done for!

110
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:19,539
What is this thing?

111
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,556
Dammit!

112
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,587
Valcon sub-machine, ok.

113
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:30,571
Firing!

114
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,570
You ok, Yamaga?

115
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,556
Yeah, somehow.

116
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,533
The heat sources have fused together.

117
00:08:58,533 --> 00:08:59,567
It appears to be a monster.

118
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,543
Understood.

119
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,510
Arrow 1, you’re cleared for takeoff.

120
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:04,510
Ibuki.

121
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,550
MAT Arrow 1 take off.

122
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,525
And Shingo

123
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:12,571
Be careful.

124
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,512
I know that dad.

125
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,569
Shingo

126
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,549
Stay safe.

127
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,583
Arrow 1 has taken off.

128
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,573
Gyro 1, 2, and 3

129
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:32,530
It appears the monster is in your vicinity.

130
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,555
Commence with the Napalm attack.

131
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:34,557
Napalm!

132
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,547
Captain.

133
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,561
Ibuki said earlier

134
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:42,598
there might still be somewhere around 5000

135
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,508
survivors in outer Hiratsune City.

136
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,551
Don’t think about it, Hayakawa.

137
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:49,555
Roger.

138
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:06,593
If that was a Kiruan underground

139
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,575
napalm won’t work.

140
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,507
Wait

141
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:11,554
even if I became Ultraman

142
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,541
could I win?

143
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,565
Did we get it?

144
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:01,552
Visual confirmation.

145
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:02,561
It's a monster.

146
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,582
Bringing it up on the display.

147
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,591
Dammit, what is this thing?

148
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,592
There’s no doubt about it, this is a Kiruan.

149
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,552
There’s an Arrow signal from above.

150
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:37,556
Team!

151
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,556
It’s Ibuki!

152
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,594
Ibuki, don’t underestimate it.

153
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,511
I got it.

154
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,572
Focusing at 50 to 60,000.

155
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:03,585
Target locked.

156
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:13,506
It appears effective.

157
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:14,560
Commencing the laser attack.

158
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,510
Shit, a barrier?

159
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,524
Come on!

160
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,535
Dammit, not enough energy.

161
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,590
Ejecting the battery pack.

162
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,517
I’m hit!

163
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:54,517
Ibuki!

164
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,560
Ibuki!

165
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:12,500
Return of Ultraman

166
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:21,500
Return of Ultraman

167
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,557
It’s been 20 hours since Lambda 1 landed in Hiratsune City.

168
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,581
As far as the monster is concerned, MAT was unable to find

169
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:39,585
a single effective weapon among their Earth Defense arsenal.

170
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:44,552
Now they can only obey the orders from EDF HQ, and wait.

171
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,536
An oppressive air fills the control room.

172
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,564
Yes, Captain Ibuki speaking.

173
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,521
Yes, understood.

174
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,500
Troops, I’ll relay the order from EDF HQ.

175
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:39,567
Today at 8 o’clock am, we will attack the monster, Lambda 1

176
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,550
with thermonuclear weapons.

177
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,510
We’ve entered into emergency level 4.

178
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,510
It will be impossible for anything to penetrate our defenses.

179
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,591
Our command center is currently moving 40 meters underground.

180
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:21,575
Imamura, take the nuclear bomb and transfer it to the MAT Arrow 1 Mk.VIII.

181
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,572
I, alone, will pilot for this attack.

182
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,539
Captain.

183
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,590
The nuclear weapons, at least stop the nuclear weapons.

184
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,590
There might still be survivors in Hiratsune City.

185
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,590
Ibuki might still be

186
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,587
Captain, please stop this.

187
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,570
Woah, Hayakawa, what are you doing?

188
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,570
Isn’t it obvious! I’m taking us out of level 4.

189
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,574
Hayakawa, stop!

190
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:48,501
We gotta stop him!

191
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,500
Let me go!

192
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:50,591
But it's coming!

193
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,588
Bastard!

194
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,525
Guys, don’t you understand what you’re doing?

195
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:56,520
Let go!

196
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,535
Stop this, Hayakawa!

197
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,500
This is our chance to avenge Ibuki!

198
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,519
But!

199
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,540
You won’t avenge your countrymen? Are you even human?

200
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,544
Confine him to his quarters

201
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:20,587
Roger!

202
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,534
Excuse us.

203
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,581
At that time, an unusually cold frost covered Hiratsune City.

204
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,564
I'm a human.

205
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,517
Or am I Ultraman?

206
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:53,577
Dammit!

207
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:08,506
Attaching thermonuclear weapons to MAT Arrow 1 Mk. VIII

208
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:18,503
Presently, MAT Arrow 1 Mk. VIII is preparing for takeoff with thermonuclear weapons

209
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,590

210
00:17:27,502 --> 00:17:29,558
MAT Arrow 1 Mk. VIII, preparing for takeoff.

211
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,569
MAT Arrow 1 Mk. VIII, clear for take off.

212
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,565
MAT Arrow 1 Mk. VIII, taking off.

213
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,565
MAT Arrow 1 Mk. VIII, taking off.

214
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,534
Are you even human?

215
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,562
An attack?

216
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,533
Block status report!

217
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,536
 C block to D3 are -

218
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:53,570
It’s Ultraman!

219
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,526
W-What?

220
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,507
It’s Ultraman. Ultraman has appeared.

221
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:08,540
He’s heading straight for Hiratsune City.

222
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:11,518
Captain, fall back. Captain.

223
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,594
20 seconds until the target.

224
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,547
Lock, disengaged. Fuse, set.

225
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,514
Preparing to release.

226
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,514
Shingo.

227
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,510
Releasing!

228
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:51,542
Ultraman?

229
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,510
That’s

230
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,528
Shingo! He's alive?

231
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:51,580
Ultraman, good luck!

232
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:32,519
Shingo.

233
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,536
Shingo! Shingo!

234
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,593
Hey, Shingo, hang in there!

235
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,503
Shingo!

236
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,590
Shingo, are you alright?

237
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,529
Shingo! Hey, Hey!

238
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:48,599
Shingo, hang in there! Shingo!

239
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,539
Destroying buildings

240
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:16,572
With the tremor that erupts

241
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:20,543
From the cries of the monster

242
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:25,517
the giant monster

243
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:28,557
It opens with a roar

244
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:32,504
And fire pours from its mouth

245
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:35,571
Scorching all of the

246
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:35,571
surrounding fields

247
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:37,514
- Ultraman, keep going!

248
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:44,565
The city is in trouble

249
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:47,539
The fire is approaching

250
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,502
He has returned

251
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,586
He has returned

252
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:54,506
He has returned!

253
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:57,573
Ultraman, Ultraman

254
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:03,524
Ultraman!

255
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:19,565
Ultraman! The nuclear weapon!

256
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:36,550
He doesn’t have long until it explodes.

257
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,564
Captain!

258
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,596
Ibuki, you’re alright!

259
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,557
I was about to make a terrible mistake.

260
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,570
Thank you, Ultraman.

261
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,595
Did Ultraman make it out ok?

262
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,518
He’s alright, I’m sure of it.

263
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,531
Don't worry, he's alright.

264
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,506
Now that it’s all over, I’m starving!

265
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:41,507
We’re going home.

266
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,572
Hayakawa.

267
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,557
Earth Defense Force, MAT member Hayakawa Ken, 21 years-old.

268
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:20,514
His true identity is Ultraman

269
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,514
as well as a human being.
